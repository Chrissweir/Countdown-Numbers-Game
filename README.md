## Introduction ##
The aim of this project was to solve the Countdown Numbers Game problem using the Racket functional programming language . I have created a program that calculates the possible combinations of six numbers that evaluate in a Equation to a single answer number with two different algorithms: A Brute Force algorithm, and a Reverse Polish Notation algorithm.

## Brute Force Algorithm ##
I originally started with my own brute force algorithm which iterates over every possible permutation of the equation. I chose this approach as at the time as I did not know of any other way to attempt this problem. To get an idea of how to develop this algorithm I first had to research the calculation factors of the game. From reading the article at http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/august32014/index.html along with studying solutions to the problem that are written in other programming languages at https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/452omr/20160210_challenge_253_intermediate_countdown/, I understood the problem better and I tried to implement some of the optimizations into my algorithm to improve the space and time complexity.
